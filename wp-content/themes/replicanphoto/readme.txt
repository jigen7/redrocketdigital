Thank you for trying the Replican Theme. If you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this readme file, please feel free to ask questions at SEThemes Support Forum.

More about the theme usage:

1. Beginning (Important)

A) Installing the theme

To be able to use the Replican WordPress Theme, you need to install WordPress on your server. If you don't know how to do it, then click on the link below that will guide you how to install WordPress. 
http://www.smallenvelop.com/blog/

To install the Replican WordPress theme, just place the theme folder “replican”  in the themes directory under wp-content and activate it from the WordPress admin. As soon as you do that, the theme will be activated on your Website.

2. Creating Pages on Website

You would need to build new pages from "Add Page" menu and select the appropriate template for each page. For e.g.-

A) For “Blog Page” choose the “Blog Template” from Page Attributes section.

B) For “Fullwidth Page” choose the “Fullwidth Template” from Page Attributes section.


3. Configuring Homepage

A) Uploading Logo & Favicon
For uploading logo and favicon,
Dashboard->Appearance->Theme options->General Settings and upload the logo and favicon into the appropriate fields.

B) Sliders on Homepage
Go to Dashboard->Appearance->Theme options->Slider Settings and upload the images for the Slider. Sliders allow upto 4 slides. By default atleast 2 slides appear on the Home Page.


4. Building Menus

Menu with Menu Manager
StartPoint Theme has a prebuilt feature of displaying all the pages and subpages in the menu. However, you can also build a custom menu using the "Menus" option under the “Appearance” Section.
